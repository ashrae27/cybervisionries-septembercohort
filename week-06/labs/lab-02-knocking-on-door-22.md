# Week 6 Lab 02 — Knocking on Door 22

**Student Name:** Ashley Raether

**Date Completed:** 10/25/2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 6  
**Submission Path:** `week-06/labs/lab-02-knocking-on-door-22.md`

> ### 🔒 Cloud Heights Security Rule
> Your Bastion link and Cloud Heights password are **private access credentials**. Never paste either into a worksheet, screenshot, GitHub repository, Circle post, or chat message. When taking screenshots, crop out the browser address bar and all login information.

## Overview

Week 5 told you SSH is how administrators reach a machine over the network, and that it knocks on **port 22**. This week you knock yourself. You are already inside Cloud Heights through Bastion — now you will open a second, nested SSH session from your machine *to itself* and watch every step of what SSH does before it lets you in.

Starts **guided**, finishes **independent**. Expect 30–40 minutes.

**This lab uses password authentication only.** SSH keys are Week 8. Do not go looking for them yet.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Cloud Heights — live Ubuntu 22.04 VM, reached through Azure Bastion |
| Username | `analyst` |
| Password | Provided separately. Never typed into this worksheet. |
| Commands used | `ssh`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `pwd`, `exit` |
| Prerequisite | Week 6 Lab 01 completed |

**Before you start:** open **My Lab Environment**, start your VM if needed, wait for **Running**, then open Cloud Heights.

## Part A — Two Ways Into the Same Room

### Step 1 — Name the Path You Already Used

You reached Cloud Heights through a browser session. Something else handled the network hop for you.

Describe, in your own words, what the Bastion/browser path did on your behalf:

```
The bastion path will use the SSH command to get access or log in to different VM machine. The browser will browse for the hostname, whoami (the person who is using the VM) and pwd, the directory they're currently working on.
```

### Step 2 — Predict the Manual Path

You are about to type an SSH command by hand. Before you run it, write what you expect to happen and what you expect to be asked for:

```
Before I type the SSH and run it, it will ask for the password.
```

---

## Part B — Knocking

### Step 1 — Run the SSH Command

In your Cloud Heights terminal, run:
```
ssh analyst@localhost
```

After you press Enter, SSH may show one of two valid responses.

- If this SSH client has not recorded `localhost` before, you may receive a **first-connection host fingerprint prompt**.
- If `localhost` is already recorded as a known host, SSH may skip that prompt and take you **directly to password authentication**.

Both are valid. Continue with the instructions that match what you see.

### Step 2 — Observe the SSH Connection

The first time SSH connects to an unfamiliar host, it may display the host's **fingerprint** and ask whether you want to continue connecting.

If the host is already recorded in your SSH `known_hosts` file, SSH may skip this confirmation and proceed directly to authentication.

**Do not reset or delete SSH trust information just to make the first-connection prompt appear.**

**If you see the fingerprint prompt:** stop and read it, record it below, answer the question that follows, and then type `yes` when you are ready to continue. A fingerprint is **not** a credential — it is a public identifier of the machine, so it is safe to record.

**If you do not see the fingerprint prompt:** this is okay. It means SSH already recognises `localhost` as a known host in this environment. Write `Host already known — fingerprint prompt not displayed.` below and continue to Step 3. You lose no credit for this.

Record what SSH showed you — paste the first-connection prompt, or write `Host already known — fingerprint prompt not displayed.`:

```
It responds: Do you want to continue connecting?. Shows you need to type the host's password.
```

Why does SSH verify a host's identity when connecting to an unfamiliar system? If you received the first-connection prompt, also explain why it was reasonable to continue in this controlled Cloud Heights lab environment:

```
The SSH verifies a host's identity when connecting to an unfamiliar system because the server requires a password for extra security, so no one in the public can get access to the system. It is reasonable to continue to do so in this controlled Cloud Heights lab environment because it asked the user " are you sure you want to continue by getting access to the localhost?".
```

### Step 3 — Enter Your Password

> ### ⚠️ PASSWORD INPUT WILL BE INVISIBLE
> When SSH asks for the `analyst` password, type or paste the password and press Enter.
>
> Linux does not display password input.
>
> You will **NOT** see:
> - letters or numbers
> - dots
> - asterisks
> - the cursor moving as characters are entered
>
> This is normal.
>
> The terminal may look like nothing is happening even though it is accepting the password.
>
> Enter the password once, press Enter once, and wait for SSH to respond.
>
> If clipboard paste does not work in your browser/Bastion terminal, type the password manually.

If you saw the fingerprint prompt, type `yes` first. Then enter your password at the password prompt.

**Troubleshooting.** If you get `Permission denied`, do not repeatedly retry credentials — capture the error and contact your instructor or post in the Lab Troubleshooting space. If you enter the password, press Enter, wait several seconds, and get neither a new prompt nor an error, capture the entire terminal state for troubleshooting. Do not restart the whole lab on your own.

What did the screen show while you typed:

```
The screen I saw when I typed it was the banner and the terms I am learning by using the Bastion Azure.
```

### Step 4 — Prove You Are in the Nested Session

Inside the new session run each of these and record the output:
```
whoami
```

```
analyst
```

```
hostname
```

```
cf-student-06
```

```
pwd
```

```
/home/analyst
```

### Step 5 — Notice the Prompt

Compare the prompt now to the prompt before you ran `ssh`. Describe anything that changed and anything that looks identical, and explain why it looks that way given where you connected to:

```
Before running the SSH command, the username looks identical. It looks that way given where I connected since the username is analyst and only the students can get access to the Azure Bastion VM.
```

### Step 6 — Capture Your Evidence

Screenshot your terminal showing the SSH connection activity. **Either** valid state is accepted:

- **State A** — a screenshot showing the SSH **first-connection / fingerprint prompt** (and the successful session), **or**
- **State B** — a screenshot showing the SSH **authentication / successful login** state when `localhost` was already a known host.

Your screenshot must show that you performed the SSH connection. You are not penalised if the fingerprint prompt was never generated.

**Required filename:** `ssh-first-connection.png` (filename kept for submission compatibility — its contents may show either state)

**Crop rules.** No Bastion URL, no address bar, no password field, no login screen. The fingerprint text, if present, is fine.

### Step 7 — Leave

Run:
```
exit
```
What did the prompt look like after exiting, and how do you know you are back in the original session:

```
The prompt said " log out, " and I received a message saying "You have been disconnected."
```

## Part C — The Deliberate Failure (Independent)

### Step 1 — Knock With the Wrong Name

Run an SSH command to `localhost` using a username that does not exist on this machine — for example `ssh notauser@localhost`. Enter anything at the password prompt.

Command you ran:

```
ssh notauser@localhost
```

Output:

```
analyst@cf-student-06:~$ ssh notauser@localhost
notauser@localhost's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
```

### Step 2 — Read the Failure Correctly

`Permission denied` is a **failure of authentication**, not a failure of the network.

Explain what the network and SSH already had to do successfully in order for you to be told "permission denied" at all:

```
The network and SSH already had to change their permissions in order to gain access to SSH. It told me "permission denied" because the permissions of the username are read and write only for the user, not execute. The permission needs to be change to read, write and execute to gain access for the SSH.
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Distinguish *reach* from *authentication*. Which one had already succeeded when you saw a password prompt, and how do you know? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The Azure Bastion login succeeded giving access to the virtual machine. I know I can get access to the Azure Bastion VMs, not other VMs, because I do not have permission to gain access to other VMs only the Azure Bastion. The Azure Bastion is a VM I am renting for educational purposes only.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** SSH records a host's identity so it can warn you if that identity ever changes. Describe a situation where accepting a host fingerprint without thinking — or ignoring a changed-host warning — would be a real problem. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The SSH host identity can change by changing the host's username since the previous host is not using the machine anymore. Accepting a host fingerprint and password is denied is the host can not get access to another host's VM. The real problem is typing the password incorrectly or the VMs name has been changed.  
```

**Analysis Question 3.** What changed and what stayed the same when you moved from the outer session into the nested SSH session, and why? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
What changed is trying to get access to another VM, but got denied when using the SSH command. What stayed the same is hostname and the username of the VM.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** A colleague says "SSH is broken, I got permission denied." Using only what you learned in this lab, what would you tell them is already working, and what would you check next? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
SSH is not broken; SSH is working, but the SSH name has the same username as the VM you're using. You should check the SSH permissions. If it says read and write only for the user, the permissions should be changed to read, write, and execute for the user only.
```
