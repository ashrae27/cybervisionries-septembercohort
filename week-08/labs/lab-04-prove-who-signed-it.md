**Student Name:** Ashley Raether

**Date Completed:** 11/5/2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-04-prove-who-signed-it.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Create a separate signing key pair, sign the incident report, verify the original, then prove that the same signature fails against a changed copy.

## What You Already Know

A digital signature uses a private key to sign and the matching public key to verify. Verification supports integrity and authenticity claims about the key. It does not encrypt the report or prove which human physically used the private key.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:** est ! -e keys/week8_signing_private.pem &&   test ! -e keys/week8_signing_public.pem &&   echo "READY: signing-key paths are unused" ||   echo "STOP: signing-key file already exists"

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography
test ! -e keys/week8_signing_private.pem &&   test ! -e keys/week8_signing_public.pem &&   echo "READY: signing-key paths are unused" ||   echo "STOP: signing-key file already exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

If it begins with `STOP`, do not overwrite or delete anything. Ask the instructor whether to resume or reset.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Should the original signature verify after the report content changes? Explain.

```text
The original signature should be verified after the report content changes because the original report ensures the passphrase is correct. The original signature passphrase can not be change and remains the same.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Generate the Private Signing Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl genpkey   -algorithm RSA   -aes-256-cbc   -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048   -out keys/week8_signing_private.pem

```bash
openssl genpkey   -algorithm RSA   -aes-256-cbc   -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048   -out keys/week8_signing_private.pem
```

Create one **signing-key passphrase** when prompted. You will use this same passphrase in Steps 2 and 4. Do not record or screenshot it.

### Step 2 — Derive the Public Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl pkey   -in keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -pubout   -out keys/week8_signing_public.pem

```bash
openssl pkey   -in keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -pubout   -out keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 3 — Confirm Both Files Exist

**[TERMINAL] Run:** ls -l keys/week8_signing_private.pem keys/week8_signing_public.pem

```bash
ls -l keys/week8_signing_private.pem keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Do not display the private-key contents.

### Step 4 — Sign the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:** ls -l keys/week8_signing_private.pem keys/week8_signing_public.pem

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -sign keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -out signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 5 — Verify the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verified OK`

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-valid.png`.

### Step 6 — Change a Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:** cp evidence/incident-report.txt signatures/incident-report-modified.txt, echo "Change: post-signature modification." >> signatures/incident-report-modified.txt

```bash
cp evidence/incident-report.txt signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
echo "Change: post-signature modification." >> signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

### Step 7 — Test the Original Signature Against the Changed Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   signatures/incident-report-modified.txt

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verification failure`. Additional OpenSSL error lines are normal for this intentional failure.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-invalid-after-change.png`.

## Stop & Check

Do not create the changed copy until Step 5 returns `Verified OK`.

### Troubleshooting

- Step 2 or 4 cannot read the private key: re-enter the Step 1 signing-key passphrase.
- Step 5 reports failure: confirm you used the original report, public key, and signature paths exactly as shown.
- Step 7 reports `Verified OK`: run `tail -n 2 signatures/incident-report-modified.txt`. If the Change line is missing, repeat Step 6 once and rerun Step 7.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, explain both verification results and why signing is not encryption.

```text
The public and the private keys are verified using a passphrase. Once the passphrase is entered, it asked for an verification to ensure the passphrase is enter is the same passphrase. Signing is not encryption because the file is signed by a passphrase to ensure the file is owned by the authorized individual who is only access to the file. The passphrase does not encrypts the file, it's kind a like a password for the file.
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What does `Verified OK` establish within this lab?

```text
'Verified ok' is established in this lab is the file is verified to be encrypted and decrypted. The user verified the file to ensure the file is ready to be encrypted ad decrypted. 
```

2. Why did the changed copy fail verification?

```text
The changed copy fails its verification because the original file can not be copied into a different file. The file can not be modified or copied; the original file remains the same.
```

3. Why is the signed report still readable?

```text
The signed report is still readable because it can only show the sign report is for the user only can read. The permissions for the sign in report are set for read and write only for the user, but not anyone else
```

4. Why does the signature alone not prove which human used the private key?

```text
The signature alone does not prove which human used the private key is the signature does not know the humans identity who uses the private key for encryption and decryption the file. The signature is only for authorized users who can use the private key to encrypt and decrypt the file.
```
